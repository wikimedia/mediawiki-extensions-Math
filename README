This version (for MediaWiki 1.19) has some changes since previous versions:

* rendering options have been reduced to just 'Always PNG' and 'Leave it as TeX'
** all other rendering options will merge to PNG.
* initial experimental support for integrating MathJax client-side rendering

See the README in the math subdirectory for more info on setting up the
low-level conversion tools.
See the README in the texvccheck subdirectory for more info on setting up the
security checking tools for MathJax and LaTeXML.

MathML support:
If you prefer MathML rather than images you can use LaTeXML to convert the
math tags to MathML. To use that feature you have to enable LaTeXML by setting
$wgMathUseLaTeXML = true;
It is possible to choose LaTeXML as default option (for anonymous user) by setting
$wgDefaultUserOptions['math'] = 'latexml';
in the LocalSettings.php file.
The LaTeXML option requires php5-curl to be installed. Without php5-curl no proper
error handling can be guaranteed.
Furthermore, a core version of wmf/1.22wmf7 or newer is recommended.
Otherwise, errors in LaTeXML can lead to mal-formatted XML output and disturb the
page layout.

MathJax configuration:
Client-side configuration of MathJax can be done by specifying a mathJax.config
table, which takes a table as described in:
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/v1.1-latest/options/index.html#configuration

Example:
if ( typeof mathJax === 'undefined' ) {
  mathJax = {};
  mathJax.config = {
    showProcessingMessages: true
  };
}

Attributes of the <math /> element:
attribute "display":
possible values: "inline", "block" or "inline-displaystyle" (default)

"display" reproduces the old texvc behavior:
The equation is rendered with large height operands (texvc used $$ $tex $$ to render)
but the equation printed to the current line of the output and not centered in a new line.
In Wikipedia users use :<math>$tex</math> to move the math element closer to the center.

"inline" renders the equation in with small height operands by adding {\textstyle $tex } to the
users input ($tex). The equation is displayed in the current text line.

"inline-displaystyle" renders the equation in with large height operands centered in a new line by adding
{\displaystyle $tex } to the user input ($tex).


For testing your installation run
php tests/phpunit/phpunit.php extensions/Math/tests/
from your MediWiki home path.

== Logging ==
The math extension supports PSR-3 logging:
Configuration can be dona via
$wgDebugLogGroups['Math'] = [ 'level' => 'info', 'destination' => '/path/to/file.log' ];
