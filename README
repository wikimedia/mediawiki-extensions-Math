This version (for MediaWiki 1.19) has some changes since previous versions:

* rendering options have been reduced to 'Leave it as TeX' and MathML (with image fallback)
** all other rendering options will merge to MathML.
* initial experimental support for integrating MathJax client-side rendering

See the README in the math subdirectory for more info on setting up the
low-level conversion tools.

Remote rendering:
For remote rendering it is recommended to install php5-curl. Without php5-curl no proper
error handling can be guaranteed.
Furthermore, a core version of wmf/1.22wmf7 or newer is recommended.
Otherwise, errors in MathML can lead to mal-formatted XML output and disturb the
page layout.

MathJax configuration:
Client-side configuration of MathJax can be done by specifying a mathJax.config
table, which takes a table as described in:
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/v1.1-latest/options/index.html#configuration

Example:
if ( typeof mathJax === 'undefined' ) {
  mathJax = {};
  mathJax.config = {
    showProcessingMessages: true
  };
}

For testing your installation run
php tests/phpunit/phpunit.php extensions/Math/tests/
from your MediWiki home path.
