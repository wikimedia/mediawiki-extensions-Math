      "message": "Removing may solve the inconsistency issue, but we\u0027d be repeating ourselves multiple times. I suppose we won\u0027t change the class name for a long time and making it a config variable also doesn\u0027t make too much sense.\n\nI haven\u0027t delved too deep into the math codebase, but I think given the problem at hand, we can remove this and think about how to make the code more maintainable in the future.",
