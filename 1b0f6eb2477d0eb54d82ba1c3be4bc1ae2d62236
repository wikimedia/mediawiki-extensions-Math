I could not find a hook in the Math extension. However, I am sure that jenkins discovered the tests in the directory /tests that ended on Test.php in the past. Maybe there was some special configuration for this extension somewhere.\nI could imagine that after this patch is merged also the coverage reporter will be able to find the /tests/phpunit directory.",
