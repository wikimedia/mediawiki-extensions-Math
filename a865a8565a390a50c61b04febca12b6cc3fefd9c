      "message": "Thats a very sensible suggestion. However, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible to have a fully automated PHPCS sniff for this that would not cause trouble by either stressing people with false positives, or missing instances it can\u0027t detect (think of \"$c \u003d count( … ); if ( $c \u003e 0 )\"). Plus I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s worth developing such a thing.\n\nThere will always be a gray area of coding style questions where developers disagree on what – essentially – is better readable. An automated sniff can not understand what \"readable\" means. That\u0027s up to us humans. Sometimes a count() might be the more readable option.",
